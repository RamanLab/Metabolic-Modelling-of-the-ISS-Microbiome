# Metabolic model reconstruction process
Genome-scale Metabolic Models (GEMs) created with the following metabolic modelling apps in KBase:
Bacterial models:
All genomes were directly imported from the NCBI RefSeq database.
Annotate Microbial Genome with RAST - v1.073 (RASTSDK v1.8.1) 
Build Metabolic Model (fba_tools v2.0.0). All bacterial models were gap-filled with RefGlucoseMinimal, setting the max uptake of Glucose alone to 10 mmol/gDWh
