There are in total 41 models that were built on 2020-10-30 using KBase. 
Annotate Microbial Genomes with RAST was used to annotate the genomes. 
Build Metabolic Model was used to reconstruct a draft model from the genome
Gap-filling set to complete media (default)
The template was set to gram-negative and gram-positive according to the microorganism considered.
Build Fungal Model was used for fungi. 
Aspergillus terreus was used as a template for Aspergillus niger
Penicillium rubens was used as the template for Penicillium rubens and Penicillium chrysogenum
Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as the template for Rhodotorula sp. JG-1b and Rhodotorula toruloides

On 24-12-20, 14 models were suspected to be incorrectly built due to an unusually low count of reactions.
Upon further investigation it was found that the genbank files used in the inital model building did not contain a sequence.
Therefore the process of model building had to be repeated using genbank files sources from other links on NCBI.
